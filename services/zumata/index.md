<!-- This template is for getting started with a Bluemix service. It is a task template intended to document productive use of the service. It is not intended for discovery and conceptual information.  -->

<!-- The name of this file should remain index.md.
Please delete out content examples and coding that you are not using for your service. -->

# Getting started with Intelligent Travel API
{: #gettingstarted}
<!-- Provide an appropriate ID above -->

<!-- Short description: REQUIRED
The short description section should include one to two sentences describing why a developer would want to use your service in an app. This should be conversational style. For search engine optimization, include the service long name and "Bluemix". Keep the {: shortdesc} after the first paragraph so that the framework renders it properly.

Examples: -->

ZUMATA’s Artificial Intelligence for personalized hotel search experience.

ZUMATA enables Artificial Intelligence for personalized hotel search experience. Our R&D in Natural Language understanding, tone analysis and image recognition read and understand complex search requirements and match users with the perfect hotel. Behind the scenes we’re compiling billions of data points from reviews, blogs, articles, social media, and even imagery to truly understand which properties offer the amenities, sentiments, or location you need.

<!-- If overview content is required, do not include it here. Put it in a separate "## About" section below the task section. -->

<!-- Task section: REQUIRED
The task section includes steps to integrate the service into the app.  
- With task-based, technical information, reduce the conversational style in favor of succinct and direct instructions.
- DO include the basic, most-common-use scenario steps to use the service or integrate it into the app. 
- DO NOT include steps to add the service from the Bluemix catalog; we assume that the user already took steps in the UI to add the service. 
- DO include code snippets in all languages that can be copied, as well as VCAP service info.  
- For additional tasks like configuring, managing, etc., add a task section (## Gerund_task_title) below the task section or "About" section if used. Use a task title such as "Configuring x", "Administering y", "Managing z". -->

<!-- You can include an optional prerequisites paragraph for any prerequisites to be met before integrating the service. For example: -->

In order to access the API, you will need an API key.

You can request an API Key by emailing apikeyrequest+ibmbluemix@zumata.com. Please state your name, company name, use case and contact information and we will get back to you.

The API key should be included in the X-Api-Key header of each request. Note that the API key is case sensitive.

<!-- Related links section: REQUIRED.
Related links display in the upper right of the getting started page. 
Ensure that you retain the lowercase anchor IDs (eg. {: #rellinks}) as shown in this template. These are used as IDs during transform and the doc framework keys off the IDs for display. 
The headings coded here are not actually used. The doc framework provides the correct headings. 
Also ensure that the related links stay in position at the end of this file or the doc framework will not display them properly.
